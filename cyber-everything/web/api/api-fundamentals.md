## Intro

An **API** (**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface) is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software, that allows one software application to interact with and use the functionality or data of another software system.

APIs:

- facilitate actions like booking rides, transferring money and fetching information.
- support both external and internal communication.
- power various applications and allow integration with partners.

**Impact and Risks**

- High-profile breaches exposed data due to API vulnerabilities.
- Addressing API-related risks is vital for security and compliance.
- Auditors focus on API security, necessitating risk assessment and mitigation.

**Attacks**

The API **back-end** application, containing the data and functionality, gets exposed to web apps, mobile apps, microservices and external parties.

- APIs often have excessive permissions, logic flaws, creating exploiting opportunities for attackers.
- API attack kill chain differs from a typical cyber attack. Once an attacker identifies a vulnerability within an API, exploiting it can result in a major breach, potentially exposing sensitive data.

APIs have regulatory considerations across industries such as banking, healthcare, and data protection. These considerations involve addressing challenges like **security** (vulnerability testing and remediation), **privacy**, and **accessibility**, while carefully managing the balance between **data accessibility** and **sensitive information protection**.

------

## Real-World API Breaches

Common breach patterns involve weak authentication, object-level authorization issues, data harvesting, exposure of sensitive data, and potential third-party risks.

Business logic flaws are often considered the most challenging API vulnerabilities to uncover. Business logic flaws are less about technical vulnerabilities and more about understanding the intended logic of the application, making them harder to detect through automated testing tools and requiring a deeper understanding of the application's functionality.

## 3 Pillars of API Security

### Governance

Developing secure APIs

Governance in API Security:

- Emphasizes the importance of consistency in API development, deployment, testing, and more.

Benefits

- Establishes expectations and requirements for the engineering team, including documentation, authentication policies, and versioning.
- Standardizes processes for moving APIs from development to production.
- Enforces security assessments to prevent the deployment of insecure APIs.

Components

- **Awareness:** Gaining visibility into existing **APIs**, their infrastructure, **data** access, and associated **risks**.
- **Policy and Process:** Defining development, deployment, and design guides/requirements for APIs to ensure a consistent and secure approach.



#### Awareness

- Involves understanding and managing your APIs, including their ownership, documentation, functionality, and locations (infrastructure, application architecture, containers, virtual machines, databases, and network interconnections).

Deployment Standardization

- Standardize the deployment process to ensure APIs are only deployed through approved channels with proper validation.
- Eliminate "shadow" or "rogue" APIs by enforcing strict governance.
- Use an API gateway or marketplace as a central control point for proper API management and validation.

Mandatory Documentation

- Make API documentation a requirement to facilitate API use within the engineering organization, with third-party clients, and partners.

Design Guides

- Define documentation requirements and create design guides for API development to ensure consistency, versioning, PII tracking.

Risk and Threat Modeling

- Involves understanding the nature of your APIs, their business flows, data access, user roles, and access controls.
- Assess risks, vulnerabilities, logic flaws, and third-party access to gain insight into API security.

Probability & Impact

- Consider the sensitivity and value of data to prioritize API security measures.
- Evaluate the impact of potential exploits, damage, loss, and consequences.

Mitigation

- Establish a plan for responding to attacks and addressing security risks in APIs.



#### Documentation

- Properly documenting APIs is crucial for security, development, and API utilization.
- The [Open API Specification (OAS)](https://swagger.io/specification/), formerly **Swagger**, is an industry standard for documenting REST APIs, offering machine-readable content (YAML or JSON).
- Well-documented APIs facilitate integration, enable usage, enhance security, support testing, and aid in runtime monitoring.

**Documentation Control**

- Control what API documentation is publicly available to ensure only necessary information is accessible.
- Regularly review and retire old documentation to mitigate security threats.

**Documentation Contents**

- API documentation defines various aspects of the API, including functionality, description, base URL, endpoints, payloads, authentication requirements, input parameters, data types, and supported methods.

**Automation for Documentation**

- Automate the generation of API specifications by instrumenting code repositories to include necessary comments and details for comprehensive documentation.



#### Design Guide Standards

- **Authentication** types and methods and their usage.
- **Authorization** mechanisms and where they are enforced (who, what, where).
- **Naming conventions** for URLs, methods, and endpoints, pluralization, hierarchy, and language choices, avoidance of jargon to enhance clarity.
- **Error code** composition, including status codes, reference IDs, and human-readable messages. Ensuring error messages do not provide useful information to potential attackers.
- **Versioning** policies, including when and when not to increment versions, units, formats, and overall design standards.



### Testing

Ensuring APIs are free of logic flaws and vulnerabilities

- Security testing should be incorporated into your overall testing program.
- It's best to test for security vulnerabilities both pre-production and in production.
- Security testing should be a part of your CI/CD pipeline to evaluate every release.
- In addition to standard security tests, such as cross-site scripting and injections, you should focus on the unique functionality of your application, as real-world breaches often result from application logic flaws (lack of authentication, authorization, and similar vulnerabilities that expose large volumes of data).
- Tailor your testing program to address the specific risks associated with your APIs.
- Attackers often bypass the UI layer and target the API directly. API-First testing is recommended.

#### Testing Categories

API Endpoint security

- Authentication exploits
- Enumeration and ID incrementing
- Rate Limit issues and Lack of encryption
- Fuzzing and Server-Side Request Forgery
- Properties leaks

Data Security

- Access controls
- Excessive data exposure and Sensitivity
- File structure and directory exposures
- Data encryption and exfiltration prevention

Business Logic

- API function abuse
- Role-based access control implementation
- Regular Pentesting



### Monitoring

Detecting threats in production with runtime active protection, threat detection, control validation.

- **Runtime Protection** includes policy enforcement, authentication, and traffic filtering
- **Threat Detection** to identify fraudulent traffic and distributed attacks
- **Incident Response** for capturing, logging, and analyzing traffic
- **Validating Controls** to ensure the functionality of gateway, firewall, and application controls



#### Approaches

Proactive Approach / Blocking

- Enforce policy with defined API Gateway, Web App Firewall

Reactive / Alerting

- Capturing, logging, and using SIEM or threat management tools
- Alerting and retracing steps for legitimate traffic when there's insufficient context



#### Discovering

- Monitoring can aid in API discovery on the network and provide insights into API usage
  - Identify active APIs, discover undocumented or unknown APIs
- However, network-based discovery has limitations and may not provide a complete view
- A comprehensive approach includes scanning code repositories, crawling, app testing, and central API management for full API visibility



#### Limitations

- Inline tools (live traffic) may not have the necessary context to detect legitimate transactions or attacks
  - Implementing authorization at the application logic level is crucial for understanding context
- Simulating attacks can help identify vulnerabilities before they go live
- Some API monitoring technologies (SaaS-based) may require sharing traffic data with third parties, potentially raising privacy, bandwidth, and latency concerns

## Application Security Technology Landscape

The Application Security Technology Landscape pertains to cybersecurity within the scope of Application Security.

API-related attacks have exposed gaps in existing security technologies.

- A development pipeline involves security tools in the development (***pre-production***) phase, scanning for **coding weaknesses**, **weak authentication** configurations, and **outdated third-party libraries**.
- In the ***production*** phase, technologies like gateways, firewalls, and API threat management tools handle authentication, authorization, traffic management, logging, and anomaly detection.

The main security gap is in API Security Testing.

- APIs differ significantly from web and mobile interfaces, making traditional web application scanners not suited for API security testing.
  - Automation and comprehensive API security testing that covers **OWASP** categories, **business logic**, authentication weaknesses, authorization gaps, and logic flaws are essential
- **Shift Left** integration of security testing into the CI/CD pipeline ensures rigorous evaluation of every release *before reaching production*.
- Automation is crucial for scalability, given the impracticality of manual penetration tests for frequent releases.

------

## Best Practices

- Enforce API governance to establish policies, standards, and processes for a structured API deployment.
  - Utilize an API gateway to enforce consistent management and operation of APIs.
- Develop a comprehensive testing program to assess every endpoint across various attack vectors.
  - Implement automation for continuous testing, creating thousands of attack scenarios to ensure thorough coverage.
- Integrate continuous testing into the CI/CD pipeline to evaluate each release regularly.
  - Stay vigilant even if APIs remain relatively static, as vulnerabilities may emerge due to alterations in code and infrastructure configurations.
- Establish and track API metrics to monitor vulnerability identification and mitigation, adding a metrics-driven process (new, existing, retired APIs).

### API Do's and Don'ts

- **Don't trust anything:** Verify and validate all inputs and network connections
- **Don't confuse obfuscation with security:** Avoid storing sensitive data like keys and tokens hard-coded in the code
- **Don't reveal useful info in error messages:** Error messages should provide minimal information
- **Don't have hidden or unadvertised features:** Ensure that your APIs are well-documented and avoid relying on users to discover hidden functionalities
- **Don't filter data in the UI:** Data filtering should be controlled by the application, not the user interface
- **Don't confuse authentication with authorization:** Authentication confirms identity, while Authorization controls access to specific functions
- **Do use API gateways:** Centralize API management and traffic control
- **Do require API documentation:** Thorough documentation is crucial for both internal and security purposes
- **Do expect hackers to find and use undocumented endpoints:** Assume that attackers will attempt to discover and exploit any undocumented API endpoints
- **Do continuous testing:** Regularly test and simulate various attack scenarios, including injections, authentication, and authorization, with automation and continuous testing procedures.
