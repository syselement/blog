# Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

## Definition

**`Threat Intelligence`** (`T.I.`) is *data that is collected, processed and analyzed to understand a threat actorâ€™s motives, targets and attack behaviors*.

- it refers to information that organizations can use to combat cyber threats
- cybersecurity experts and data scientists examine, visualize and analyze large volumes of unorganized data to turn it into actionable insights that power informed decisions

> *Threat intelligence is evidence-based knowledge, including context, mechanisms, indicators, implications and actionable advice, about an existing or emerging menace or hazard to assets that can be used to inform decisions regarding the subject's response to that menace or hazard.* - [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/2487216)

[`Cyberattacks`](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/cyberattacks/) - malware, ransomware, phishing, man-in-the-middle, denial-of-service, APTs ...

### 3 Types of TI

Maturity curve - The context and analysis of CTI become deeper and more sophisticated with each level.

`TACTICAL` - *focus on the immediate future and identifies simple indicators of compromise (**`IOCs`**)* by performing malware analysis/enrichment and ingesting threat indicators into defensive systems.

- almost always automated (feeds)
- IOCs short lifespan
- Stakeholders: SOC Analyst, SIEM, Firewall, Endpoints, IDS/IPS

`OPERATIONAL` - *focus on understanding the attack adversaries, campaign tracking and actor profiling (the "who", the "why" and "how")*.

- human analysis needed, longer useful life
- Stakeholders: Threat Hunter, SOC Analyst, Vulnerability Management, Incident Response, Insider Threat

`STRATEGIC` - *focus on understanding trends and adversarial motives, engage in strategic security, inform business decisions and the processes behind them*.

- shows how global events, foreign policies, and other long-term local and international movements can potentially impact the cyber security of an organization

- Stakeholders: CISO, CIO, CTO, Executive Board, Strategic Intel

## Lifecycle

![crowdstrike.com - Â© CrowdStrike](.gitbook/assets/threat-intelligence-lifecycle-3.png)

**`T.I. lifecycle`** - the process of *turning raw data into finished intelligence for decision-making and action*.

Every research is based on a variety of different versions of the intelligence cycle, but the *end aim is always the same*: **to lead a cybersecurity team through the development and execution of an effective threat intelligence program**.

- `Requirements` - sets the scope/roadmap (goals & methodology) for a specific threat intelligence operation

```
- Which types of assets, processes, and personnel are at risk?
- How will threat intelligence improve operational efficiency for my team?
- What other systems and applications could benefit?
```

- `Collection` - data gathering to satisfy objectives (traffic logs, OSINT, etc)

```
- Where are your current internal and external blindspots?
- What technical and automated collection techniques can you employ?
- How well can you infiltrate cybercriminal forums and closed sources on the dark web?
```

- `Processing` - raw data filtered, categorized, translated into an analysis-suitable format
- `Analysis` - find answers to the posed questions, asses intelligence significance and severity, spot IOCs (indicators of compromise)

```
- Which types of assets, processes, and personnel are at risk?
- How will threat intelligence improve operational efficiency for my team?
- What other systems and applications could benefit?
```

- `Dissemination` - translate analysis into a digestible format report for stakeholders/audience, analysts

```
- What are the most important findings of the analysis, and whatâ€™s the best way to illustrate them?
- With what degree of confidence is the analysis reliable, relevant, and accurate?
- Are there clear and concrete recommendations or next steps regarding the end analysis?
```

- `Feedback` - receive stakeholder feedback establishing future adjustments and reports

```
- Which stakeholders benefit from finished threat intelligence reporting?
- What is the best way to present the intelligence and at what delivery frequency?
- Ultimately, how valuable is the finished intelligence? How actionable is it, and does it enable your organization to make informed security decisions? 
- And, finally, how can you improve on it going forwardâ€”both in terms of finished intelligence and ameliorating your organizationâ€™s intelligence cycle?
```

## Standards and Frameworks

### [STIX & TAXII](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/)

Cyber Threat Intelligence is shared/exchanged with tools, products or other entities via two (independent) standards - **STIX** and **TAXII**.

**`STIX`** ([**S**tructured **T**hreat **I**nformation E**x**pression](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro)) - an open-source structured **language** and serialization format used to exchange CTI, designed to improve:

- collaborative threat analysis
- automated threat exchange
- automated detection and response, and more
- [STIX examples](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/examples)

![STIX Relationship Example - oasis-open.github.io](.gitbook/assets/stix2_relationship_example_2.png)

**`TAXII`** ([**T**rusted **A**utomated E**x**change of **I**ntelligence **I**nformation](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/taxii/intro)) - a transport mechanism, an application layer **protocol** for the communication of cyber threat information in a simple and scalable manner, over HTTPS.

- designed to support the exchange of STIX-represented CTI
- can be used to share non-STIX data

![TAXII Collections - oasis-open.github.io](.gitbook/assets/taxii_diagram.png)

> STIX states the *what* of T.I. and it is the *packaging*.
>
> TAXII defines the *how* and is the *vehicle carrying* the package.
>
> STIX and TAXII are *machine-readable* and can easily be *automated*.
