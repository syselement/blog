# CVSS v3.1

**`CVSS`** (**Common Vulnerability Scoring System**) - vendor-agnostic, industry-open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help determine urgency and priority of response.

- Maintained by `FIRST` (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams)

## Objectives

- Describe CVSS v.3.1 metrics and importance in CVSS scoring
- Identify vulnerable/impacted components and establish importance
- CVSS calculator usage for vuln evaluation

## Base Metrics Part 1

> Base Metric group represents the intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and across user environments.

ðŸ“Œ **Security Scope** - the collection of privileges defined by a security authority when granting access to computing resources

ðŸ“Œ **Vulnerable component** - vulnerable software application, module, driver or hardware device

- [CVSS v3.1 Calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator)

**`e.g. 1`** Vulnerable Web App - requires log in, denies access to users in blacklist banned users. Blacklist changes require a administrative password

- Authentication Bypass Vulnerability: non-default configuration - a privileged user can change the blacklist without admin password.
  - GET request to blacklist users file
  - if requestor is a privileged user > authentication prompt > authorized = make the request
  - if requestor is not a privileged user > request discarded
  - an attacker with unprivileged access can send a malicious HTTP GET request to the server to perform actions on the blacklist users file and modify it, without explicit authorisation
- Vulnerable web app fails to properly handle user input

### Attack Vector (AV)

- *Reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible.*
  - External/Internet attackers > Local/Physical attackers
  - **e.g.** SSH RCE, usage of remote access protocols: AV Network or Adjacent Network
- The *Base Score increases the farther* (logically+physically) the attacker can be from the target

![Attack Vector Rubric](.gitbook/assets/Mod3_Slide024.png)

In the **`e.g. 1`** , the Attack Vector is `Network (AV:N)`

### Attack Complexity (AC)

- *Describes the conditions beyond the attacker's control, that must exist in order to exploit the vuln*
- Excludes user interaction in order to exploit the vuln
- The *Base Score increases the most for the least complex attacks (= attack performed at will)*

![Attack Complexity Rubric](.gitbook/assets/Mod3_Slide030.png)

In the **`e.g. 1`** , the Attack Complexity is `Low (AC:L)` - non default setting allowing HTTP GET request to modify a config file, vulnerable component is in that configuration

### Privileges Required (PR)

- *Describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vuln*
- The *Base Score increases as fewer privileges are required*

![Privileges Required Rubric](.gitbook/assets/Mod3_Slide037.png)

In the **`e.g. 1`** , the Privileges Required is `Low (PR:L)` - the attacker needs to login to the web app with a basic unprivileged user

### User Interaction (UI)

- *Captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable component*
- The *Base Score is greater when no user interaction is required*

![User Interaction Rubric](.gitbook/assets/Mod3_Slide043.png)

In the **`e.g. 1`** , the User Interaction is `Required (UI:R)` - requires a privileged user to open a malicious URL

## Base Metrics Part 2

### Scope (S)

ðŸ“Œ **Vulnerable component** - *the thing that is vulnerable* = Security Scope that contains the vuln

ðŸ“Œ **Impacted component** - *the thing that suffers the impact* = Security Scope that is affected by the vuln

![Three Security Scopes](.gitbook/assets/cvss_m003s049a.png)

- *Consider the security scope of both components (vulnerable & impacted) and see whether there is a change*
- The *Base Score is greater when systems beyond the vulnerable component are impacted*

![Scope Rubric](.gitbook/assets/Mod3_Slide053.png)

In the **`e.g. 1`** , the Scope is `Unchanged (S:U)` - the web app is both the vulnerable & impacted component

### Base Metrics Overview

![Base Metrics Overview](.gitbook/assets/Mod3_Slide054.png)

### Confidentiality Impact (C)

- *Measures the impact to the **confidentiality** of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability*

- The *Base Score increases with the degree of information **disclosed***

![Confidentiality Impact Rubric](.gitbook/assets/Mod3_Slide067.png)

In the **`e.g. 1`** , the Confidentiality Impact is `None (C:N)` - the attacker cannot access any information he has already access to

### Integrity Impact (I)

- *Measures the impact to **data trustworthiness and veracity** resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability*

- The *Base Score increases with the degree of information that can be **modified***

![Integrity Impact Rubric](.gitbook/assets/Mod3_Slide074.png)

In the **`e.g. 1`** , the Integrity Impact is `Low (I:l)` - the attacker can only modify a configuration file that he did not already have the ability to change

### Availability Impact (A)

- *Measures the impact to the **availability** of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vuln*

- The *Base Score increases with the degree of disruption of availability

![Availability Impact Rubric](.gitbook/assets/Mod3_Slide081.png)

In the **`e.g. 1`** , the Availability Impact is `High (A:H)` - the attacker can make the service unreachable, by modifying the blacklist configuration file

![CVSS Base Score](.gitbook/assets/image-20230728105842854.png)

## Temporal Metrics

> Temporal Metric group reflects the characteristics of a vulnerability that may change over time but not across user environments
>
> - Measure the current state of exploit techniques or code availability, the existence of patches/workarounds, or confidence in the description of a vuln
> - Are expected to change over time and need to be adjusted

![Temporal Score Metrics](.gitbook/assets/image-20230728110635303.png)

### Exploit Code Maturity (E)

- *Measures the likelihood of the vulnerable component being attacked. Typically is based on the current state of exploit techniques, code availability or active exploitation*

In the **`e.g. 1`** , the Exploit Code Maturity is `Proof oc concept code (E:P)` - POC code is available for the Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

### Remediation Level (RL)

- Remediation level is important for prioritisation, based on vuln patch, workarounds and hotfixes
- The less official and permanent a fix, the higher the vulnerability score

In the **`e.g. 1`** , the Remediation Level is `Temporary fix (RL:T)` - the vendor of the web app has released a temporary fix

### Report Confidence (RC)

- Measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vuln and the credibility of the known technical details
- A vulnerability rated as **confirmed** has the higher score

In the **`e.g. 1`** , the Report Confidence Level is `Reasonable (RC:R)` - researchers do not have full confidence in the root cause of the vuln

![Temporal Score](.gitbook/assets/image-20230728111536108.png)

## Environmental Metrics

> Environmental Metric group represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that are relevant and unique to a particular user's environment.
>
> - Customize the CVSS score depending on the importance of the affected IT asset to a user's organization
> - The metrics are the modified equivalent of base metrics and their assigned values based on the component placement in the organizational infrastructure

![Environmental Score Metrics](.gitbook/assets/image-20230728112822035.png)

![e.g. 1 - Environmental Score](.gitbook/assets/image-20230728113019306.png)

## Vector String

- Qualitative **Severity Rating** Scale
  - All scores con be mapped to the qualitative ratings defined
  - Optional
  - Intended to help properly assess and prioritize the vulnerability management process

### Scenario 2

**`e.g. 3`** - machine-tooling organization's website, embedded SQL database for data storage. Website is on internal LAN, not public. Site creates SQL statements with data by users and passes it to the database. Insufficient validation of this data allows SQL-injection attack.

### Scenario 3

**`e.g. 4`** - Buffer overflow on vulnerable document viewer. A careful malformed image, opened by a user, can contain malicious code and takes over the program. Attacker emails the malformed document and the victim opens it.
