```bash
sudo apt install -y virtualbox adb
sudo wget https://dl.genymotion.com/releases/genymotion-3.5.1/genymotion-3.5.1-linux_x64.bin -O /tmp/genymotion.bin

sudo chmod +x genymotion.bin
sudo ./genymotion.bin

cd /opt/genymobile/genymotion
./genymotion
```

- Install a new Google Pixel 3 XL device

- Run Burpsuite and copy its certificate

```bash
cd
curl localhost:8080/cert -o cert.der
sudo mv cert.der /usr/share/ca-certificates/BurpSuiteCA.der

openssl x509 -inform der -in /usr/share/ca-certificates/BurpSuiteCA.der -out burp.pem
openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash_old -in burp.pem
mv burp.pem 9a5ba575.0 	# Output from above
```

- Copy cert to device

```bash
adb devices -l
adb shell
su
mount -o remount,rw /
exit
exit

adb push 9a5ba575.0 /system/etc/security/cacerts/
```

- To start capturing traffic with BurpSuite, set the proxy listener to `All interfaces`

![](.gitbook/assets/2023-07-02_17-25-13_135.png)

- Set the proxy usage on the device, with the KaliVM IP

```bash
adb shell settings put global http_proxy 192.168.31.128:8080

# Create an alias for set and unset proxy
alias adb_set_proxy="adb shell settings put global http_proxy $(ip -o -4 addr show eth1 | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/\/.*//g'):8080"

alias adb_unset_proxy="adb shell settings put global http_proxy :0"
```

- From Genymotion, click OpenGAPPS to install Gapps on the device and restart the device.

```bash
# Disable proxy
adb_unset_proxy
```

- Run Play Store on the device and install apps
  - `e.g.` - Wayzn, Instagram - in this case

- Try to set the proxy, turn BurpSuite intercept on and login into the *Wayzn* app

```
adb_set_proxy
```

- Open Instagram and try to login. `Unable to log in` with proxy set.

- Unsetting the proxy, Instagram error changes.
  - Instagram prevents from intercepting the traffic

- Install Frida
  - ðŸ”— Follow [Frida Android](https://frida.re/docs/android/)

```bash
# On KaliVM
pipx install frida-tools                                   

# On device
adb shell
uname -a
	Linux localhost 5.10.101-genymotion+-ab74 #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Dec 1 14:03:02 UTC 2022 x86_64

# x86_64 -  Download frida-server-16.1.1-android-x86_64.xz
exit
wget https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/16.1.1/frida-server-16.1.1-android-x86_64.xz

7z x frida-server-16.1.1-android-x86_64.xz
mv frida-server-16.1.1-android-x86_64 frida-server

adb push frida-server /data/local/tmp/
adb shell "chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server"
adb shell "/data/local/tmp/frida-server &"
```

- Check  **Frida** is working

```bash
frida-ps -U		# This is device output
     PID  Name
    ----  -------------------------------------------------------------
    5446  Google Play Store
    6085  Instagram
    1960  Phone
    5249  Wayzn
     473  adbd
    1268  android.ext.services
    [...]
```

- Download the [Instagram SSL Pinning Bypass](https://github.com/Eltion/Instagram-SSL-Pinning-Bypass) script
  22:15 - Setting the proxy and showing us intercept instagram traffic

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/android/instagram
cd /opt/android/instagram

sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eltion/Instagram-SSL-Pinning-Bypass/main/instagram-ssl-pinning-bypass.js
```

- Force stop Instagram app from App info
- Use Frida to start Instagram and load the script to bypass the SSL Checking

```bash
adb_set_proxy
frida -U -l ./instagram-ssl-pinning-bypass.js -f com.instagram.android
```

![](.gitbook/assets/2023-07-02_18-07-35_139.png)

- Show Instagram intercepted traffic in BurpSuite
