**DevOps Pipeline**

Test ‚û°Ô∏è Build ‚û°Ô∏è Deploy ‚û°Ô∏è Configure ‚û°Ô∏è Monitor

DevOps engineers have some know-how from both *DEV* and *OPERATIONs* teams, plus additional DevOps specific technical skills, the core one being building **CI/CD** (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery-Deployment) **pipelines**.

## Software Development

Methodologies of software development:

- Waterfall
- [Agile](https://asana.com/resources/agile-methodology) (newer)
  - several project phases
  - each feature is tested, deployed
  - fast development, testing and deployment cycles
  - Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery
  - it supports the need for DevOps tasks (best practices, automation tools ...)

The DevOps engineer needs to assist developers in building the application. This involves configuring automation tools (**CI/CD Pipelines**) to handle tests, build processes, and packaging the applications into Docker images. Finally, the DevOps engineer ensures the app runs smoothly on deployment servers.

**Artifacts** are apps built into a single file (`jar`, `war`, `zip`, `tar`, etc). An **artifact repository** can store many different artifact formats by using a manager for managing them all.

- [Nexus](https://help.sonatype.com/en/sonatype-nexus-repository.html) - private/internal usage
  - multi-format support
  - LDAP integration, user token support
  - REST API integration
  - Backup, restore
  - Tagging
  - Cleanup policies
  - Search functionality
- [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) - public (Java)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - public (Javascript)

## IaaS

**Infrastructure as a Service** (IaaS) offers compute, storage and networking on-demand from the cloud providers.

**Cloud computing** refers to the **delivery of computing services** (servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more) over the internet, allowing users to access and utilize these resources on-demand.
