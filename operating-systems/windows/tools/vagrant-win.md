> - [Vagrant Installation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/installation)
>   - [Download](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads) and Run the installer for Windows system.
>   - The installer will automatically add `vagrant` to your system path so that it is available in terminals.
>   - Verify the correct installation using the **`vagrant`** command inside PowerShell.
>
> - The primary function of the [Vagrantfile](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/vagrantfile) is to describe the type of machine required for a project, and how to configure and provision these machines. Vagrantfiles are called Vagrantfiles because the actual literal filename for the file is `Vagrantfile`.
> - Vagrant is meant to run with one Vagrantfile per project.
> - When you run any `vagrant` command, Vagrant climbs up the directory tree looking for the first Vagrantfile it can find, starting first in the current directory.
>   - This feature lets you run `vagrant` from any directory in your project.
> - Find more boxes at [HashiCorp's Vagrant Cloud box catalog](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover)

## Default Provider

- *If you have the VMware provider installed, it will always take priority over VirtualBox.*
- Check more infos about Default Providers [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/providers/basic_usage#default-provider)
- E.g.

```powershell
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # ... other config up here

  # Prefer VirtualBox before VMware Workstation
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox"
  config.vm.provider "vmware_desktop"
end
```

---

## VirtualBox

- Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) & VirtualBox Extension Pack (default Vagrant provider)
- Create a new directory for the **vargrant project**
- Open `PowerShell` and move into the project directory
- Initialize the directory with a box, in this case the [`hashicorp/bionic64`](https://app.vagrantup.com/hashicorp/boxes/bionic64) box will be used

```powershell
vagrant init hashicorp/bionic64
```

![](.gitbook/assets/image-20230201222028027.png)

- `box add` subcommand can be used to install a box without creating a new Vagrantfile
  - ***do not** add it if already initialized*

```powershell
vagrant box add hashicorp/bionic64
```

> This will download the box named `hashicorp/bionic64` from [HashiCorp's Vagrant Cloud box catalog](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover), where you can find and host boxes.
>
> Boxes are globally stored for the current user. Each project uses a box as an initial image to clone from, and never modifies the actual base image. This means that if you have two projects both using the `hashicorp/bionic64` box you just added, adding files in one guest machine will have no effect on the other machine.

- Use the box as a base in the project by opening the `Vagrantfile`. Content must be:

```powershell
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "hashicorp/bionic64"
end
```

> The `hashicorp/bionic64` in this case must match the name you used to add the box above. This is how Vagrant knows what box to use. If the box was not added before, **Vagrant will automatically download and add the box when it is run.**

- Bring up the virtual machine

```powershell
vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
```

![vagrant up --provider=virtualbox](.gitbook/assets/vagrant_up.gif)

- VirtualBox - created and started VM

![](.gitbook/assets/image-20230201225837477.png)

- SSH into the machine:

```bash
vagrant ssh

vagrant@127.0.0.1's password:
Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-58-generic x86_64)

- Destroy the machine

```powershell
vagrant destroy
```

![](.gitbook/assets/image-20230201230348120.png)

- Remove the box

```powershell
vagrant box list
	hashicorp/bionic64 (virtualbox, 1.0.282)
vagrant box remove hashicorp/bionic64
```

- Extras:

  - Suspend the VM
    - The virtual machine will still use disk space while suspended, and requires additional disk space to store the state of the virtual machine RAM.
  
  
  ```powershell
  vagrant suspend
  ```
  
  - Gracefully shutdown the VM
    - Halting your machine will cleanly shut it down, preserving the contents of disk and allowing you to cleanly start it again.
  
  
  ```powershell
  vagrant halt
  ```

## VMware Workstation

- [Install VMware](../../../home-lab/hypervisors/vmware/vmware-workstation.md)
- To upgrade the Vagrant VMware utility, download the latest version from the [Vagrant VMware utility downloads page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads/vmware) and install the system package to your local system.
- You can install or update the Vagrant VMware plugin to the latest version by re-running the install command:

```powershell
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-desktop

vagrant plugin update
```

![](.gitbook/assets/image-20230201211135873.png)

- Create a new directory for the **vargrant project**
- Open `PowerShell` and move into the project directory
- Initialize the directory with a box, in this case the [`hashicorp/bionic64`](https://app.vagrantup.com/hashicorp/boxes/bionic64) box will be used

```powershell
vagrant init hashicorp/bionic64
```

![](.gitbook/assets/image-20230201222028027.png)

- Set the GUI in the `Vagrantfile` to show the VMs in the VMware dashboard ([provider settings here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/providers/vmware/configuration))

```ruby
config.vm.provider "vmware_desktop" do |v|
    v.gui = true
end
```

- Bring up the virtual machine and try to SSH into it

```powershell
vagrant up --provider=vmware_desktop
vagrant ssh
```

![vagrant up --provider=vmware_desktop](.gitbook/assets/vagrant_up_vmware.gif)

- VMware Workstation - created and started VM

![](.gitbook/assets/image-20230202001619324.png)

- Shutdown the VM and destroy it

```powershell
vagrant halt
vagrant destroy
```

> 📌
>
> - After stopping the VM with `vagrant halt`, at the second boot with `vagrant up` this error could appear ❗:
>
> ***Vagrant encountered an error while attempting to prune unused
> port forward entries***
>
> - To solve this port forwarding issue use this command:
>
> ```powershell
> vagrant cap provider scrub_forwarded_ports
> ```
>
> - Then bring up again the VM with `vagrant up --provider=vmware_desktop` command.
